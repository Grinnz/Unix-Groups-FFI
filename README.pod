=head1 NAME

Unix::Groups::FFI - Interface to Unix group syscalls

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Unix::Groups::FFI qw(getgroups setgroups initgroups);

  my @gids = getgroups;
  setgroups(@gids);
  initgroups($username, $gid);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a FFI interface to several syscalls related to Unix
groups, including L<getgroups(2)>, L<setgroups(2)>, and L<initgroups(3)>. As
such it will only work on Unix-like operating systems.

=head1 EXCEPTION HANDLING

All functions will throw an exception containing the syscall error message on
error. L<perlvar/"$!"> will also have been set by the syscall, so you could
check it after trapping the exception for finer exception handling:

  use Unix::Groups::FFI 'setgroups';
  use Syntax::Keyword::Try;
  use Errno qw(EINVAL EPERM ENOMEM);

  try { setgroups((0)x2**16) }
  catch {
    if ($! == EINVAL) {
      die 'Tried to set too many groups';
    } elsif ($! == EPERM) {
      die 'Insufficient privileges to set groups';
    } elsif ($! == ENOMEM) {
      die 'Out of memory';
    } else {
      die $@;
    }
  }

See the documentation for each syscall for details on the possible error codes.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

All functions are exported individually on demand. A function will not be
available for export if the system does not implement the corresponding
syscall.

=head2 getgroups

  my @gids = getgroups;

Returns the supplementary group IDs of the current process via L<getgroups(2)>.

=head2 setgroups

  setgroups(@gids);

Sets the supplementary group IDs for the current process via L<setgroups(2)>.
Attempting to set more than C<NGROUPS_MAX> groups (32 before Linux 2.6.4 or
65536 since Linux 2.6.4) will result in an C<EINVAL> error. The C<CAP_SETGID>
L<capability|capabilities(7)> or equivalent privilege is required.

=head2 initgroups

  initgroups($username, $gid);
  initgroups($username);

Initializes the supplementary group access list for the current process to all
groups of which C<$username> is a member, also including C<$gid>, via
L<initgroups(3)>. If C<$username> does not exist on the system, the
supplementary group access list will be set only to C<$gid>. The C<CAP_SETGID>
L<capability|capabilities(7)> or equivalent privilege is required.

As a special case, the primary group ID of C<$username> is included if C<$gid>
is not passed (an C<EINVAL> error will result if the username does not exist).
